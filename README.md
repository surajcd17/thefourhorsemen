# Terms and Conditions Summarizer

## 🚀 Motivation
This project was developed during a college hackathon to address the lack of awareness about the often overlooked *Terms and Conditions* found on various websites. Our Chrome extension provides users with a quick, AI-generated summary of these documents, making them easier to understand and access.

## 🧠 What It Does
The extension automatically detects Terms and Conditions pages and generates a concise summary to help users grasp the key points without reading through lengthy legal text.

## 🛠️ How to Use
Currently, the extension is under development and not yet available for public installation. We're actively working to polish the code and make it user-ready in the near future. Stay tuned!

## ⚠️ Known Issues
- The extension may not work consistently across all websites.
- Backend integration is ongoing and might cause occasional failures in summary generation.

We're aware of these issues and are working to improve performance and compatibility.
